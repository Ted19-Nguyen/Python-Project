# Python-Project

In this project, I worked with a healthcare dataset to predict heart failure using machine learning techniques. 

I split the data for training and testing and applied logistic regression and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) models to make predictions. 

By evaluating the performance of each model, I gained valuable insights into their effectiveness in predicting heart failure.
