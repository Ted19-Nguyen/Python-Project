# Python-Project
## Overview:
In this project, I worked with a healthcare dataset to predict heart failure using machine learning techniques. 

The data is split for training & testing, then predictions are made by logistic regression and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) models. 

By evaluating the performance of each model, I gained valuable insights into their effectiveness in predicting heart failure.

## Conclusion:
The analysis suggests that while Logistic Regression with RFE is highly effective, the KNN model, when optimized with the right hyperparameters, can be slightly more adept at handling this particular prediction task.
